# proto-marmiton-premium type 👩🏽‍🍳

## what about this project 🧠 ? 

This project is the prototype of my final project which is to build an app that helps the user to chose a recipe in function of what they have in their kitchen. It will take in account parameters like price rating, time index, difficulty level and others. 

## Main feature 🛠️

# menu 
  - food inventory
  - ustensils & __ inventory
  - profile creation
  - find recipe (entrée/plat/dessert)
  - create a recipe

## architecture 
The project is divided into different files to have a better and well-organised structure. 

## data managment 
panda/or numpy

## saving data 
json

To be continued :D
